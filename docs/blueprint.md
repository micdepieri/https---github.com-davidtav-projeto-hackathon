# **App Name**: Cool Cities Climate Planner

## Core Features:

- Automated Diagnostics: Use geospatial AI to map urban vegetation cover, surface temperature, population density, soil permeability, and proximity to critical infrastructure to identify priority zones for green intervention.
- Smart Recommendations: Use a machine learning model to correlate environmental variables and suggest optimal locations, native plant species, and planting density to maximize temperature reduction.
- Impact Simulation & Reporting: Automatically generate technical reports and visualizations showing before/after vegetation cover, estimated temperature reduction, and potential climate credits, ready for integration into municipal plans.
- Conversational Assistant: A chatbot with generative AI tool (like ChatGPT) simplifies usage by providing an intuitive interface for managers without technical training to query the system and generate planting plans.
- Agroforestry Integration: Identify degraded peri-urban areas suitable for urban agroforestry, suggest appropriate species, and calculate expected temperature reduction, carbon sequestration, and potential income generation.
- Interactive Mapping: Display the AI powered analysis on an interactive map.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft green (#90EE90) to evoke nature and sustainability.
- Background color: Very light desaturated green (#F0FFF0) for a clean, calming feel.
- Accent color: Warm yellow-orange (#FFB347) for highlighting key data and calls to action.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans', a modern yet humanist sans-serif for readability and approachability.
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro' for any displayed code snippets.
- Use clear and informative icons related to urban planning, climate data, and vegetation.
- Subtle transitions and animations to guide the user through data layers and insights.
